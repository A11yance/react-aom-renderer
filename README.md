# react-aom-renderer

Render React to [Accessibility Object Model (AOM)](https://github.com/wicg/aom).

## Motivation

The A11yance is curious to explore the practical applications of AOM. We identified the following high level goals for this project:

  1. Friendship
  2. Better testing with high-fidelity representations
  3. Complex application authoring via direct AOM manipulation

Friendship, of course, because we are all trying to solve the same problem: how do we build delightful, robust user interfaces for assistive technologies in modern engineering organizations? And we'll get there faster if we work together.

We believe that tools that provide high-fidelity representations of accessibility API structures allow us to build better testing tools and ultimately, better user interfaces. Maybe AOM helps us here; maybe not. But we'll learn a lot in the process nonetheless.

We hope that AOM support will give us the bare-metal tools we need to build truly innovative and delightful interfaces that support the unique interaction paradigms of assistive technology.
